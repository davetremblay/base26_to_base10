# base26_to_base10

This is mostly a program I made as a challenge to myself in my first week of learning Python. I received considerable help, however. I don't think this function can be really useful. Maybe just yet another oddity.

Input: 

-one word (text)

Output:

-a number (integer)

Feel free to use it if you find it useful!
